Tennis refactoring kata
=======================

Imagine you work for a consultancy company, and one of your colleagues has been doing some work for the Tennis Society. The contract is for 10 hours billable work, and your colleague has spent 8.5 hours working on it. Unfortunately he has now fallen ill, although he says he has completed the work, and the tests all pass. 

Your boss has asked you to take over and spend an hour or so on it so she can bill the client for the full 10 hours. She instructs you to tidy up the code a little and perhaps make some notes so you can give your colleague some feedback on his chosen design. There are three scenarios for this refactoring kata - imagine three different consultancy companies each with their own solution to the problem. 

I suggest you start with the first version of the code. When youâ€™ve got that looking beautiful, start over with the second and third versions. What is nice about this Kata is that the tests are almost exhaustive, and fast to run, so any mistakes you make while refactoring should be very obvious. You should not need to change the tests, only run them often as you refactor.
