Buggy Pricer refactoring kata
=============================

Hi and welcome to the development trading tools team.

As you know, we are a small development team and we have fired the developer which had created this code.
The trading desk is upset and we have to produce a new version very soon.

The trading team is asking for two major improvements:

+ You have to increase +1 the today price
+ Consider only the underlying product name starting with the letter C

Feel free to make any changes, excepted all public stuff, and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly.
